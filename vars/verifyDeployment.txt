# verifyDeployment

## Summary
DEPRECATION NOTICE
This method has been deprecated in favor of the 'rollout' method in this repository.  Calling that method with the 
'latest' flag set to false will replicate the behavior of this method.

Verify a DeploymentConfig has deployed successfully.

## Usage

### Requirements

Requires Jenkins agent with:
- OC

### Parameters

The method supports the following parameters:
```groovy
// verifyDeployment.groovy#L4-L12

//Required
String targetApp

//Optional - Platform
String clusterUrl = ""
String clusterAPI = ""
String clusterToken = ""
String projectName = ""
Integer loglevel = 0
```

### Example

```groovy
// ../test/Jenkinsfile-verifyDeployment#L16-L20

stage("TEST: Can verify deployment") {
    verifyDeployment([
            targetApp: "verifydeployment"
    ])
}
```

### Local vs Remote cluster support

As the underlying technology used is the [openshift-client-plugin](https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-client-plugin),
the ability to connect to a the local cluster, a cluster via URL/Token or using
[Jenkins configuration](https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-client-plugin#configuring-an-openshift-cluster) is as easy
as setting the clusterAPI and clusterToken parameters.
